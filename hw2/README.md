Note: The flow of the steps in the assignment is in such a way that it helps with your learning and understanding. As explained in Step 8 in the attached document, the application should be built using the AWS Cloudformation Template.

Additional Note: There are some features in the assignment spec that you do not need to implement. We did not remove them from the assignment pdf so that you can have an idea of how things would be done in a production system. But for the purposes of this assignment, you can skip them. They are as follows:

1. You do not need to deploy your services inside VPC.

2. Because you are not using VPC, there is no need to configure a SECURITY GROUP. While you will be setting up IAM roles and other permissions which are required for your application to function, there is no need to set up a SECURITY GROUP mentioned as SG1 in the assignment spec.

3. It is not necessary for you to use AWS Transcribe for implementing the voice-to-text conversion feature. Instead, you can use VanillaJS's support of voice-to-text conversion or any other method/library that you find easier to use in your frontend framework.
